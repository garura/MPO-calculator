# MPO-calculator

This is a computational chemistry application that I developed as a software consultant to a well known drug designer in the pharmaceutical industry.  It uses the Multiparameter Optimization (MPO) algorithm to predict the permeability of a drug into the brain based on the structural properties of the molecule.  The algorithm was developed empirically from a large dataset of drugs that are known to be pharmaceutically active in the central nervous system (CNS), and was published in the following paper:  Wager TT et al (2010), Moving beyond Rules: The Development of a Central Nervous System Multiparameter Optimization (CNS MPO) Approach To Enable Alignment of Druglike Properties. ACS Chem Neurosci 1:435â€“49.
